        <p>This map shows the all tagged objects in the <a
        href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> database. Zoom
        in to level 14 or above to get an interactive map.</p>
        <h2>Interactive Map</h2>
        <p>Hovering over objects will show the objects with their tags in a box
        on the right.</p>
        <p>Click on the map to lock the selected object(s). The list of
        selected objects will not change any more when the mouse moves over
        other objects. Use the <tt>Esc</tt> key to unlock or click on the
        map again.</p>
        <p>It is possible that there are several objects under the mouse
        pointer. In that case all objects are highlighted in yellow on the map
        and they will all show up in the box on the right. One of the objects
        is additionally highlighted in red and gets a red border in the box on
        the right. Use the PgUp/PgDown keys or hold down the Shift key and use
        the scroll wheel of the mouse to cycle through the red main
        selection.</p>
        <p>If you have locked the selection, you can also click on the circled
        numbers of a selected object in the box on the right to make it the
        main selection.</p>
        <h2>Selected Objects</h2>
        <p>On the right you can see the selected object(s). Click on an object
        ID to open the objects page on www.openstreetmap.org.</p>
        <p>Click on the zoom button â›¶ to center and zoom the map to that object.
        This will not work for larger objects, because on lower zoom levels the
        selection is not shown.</p>
        <p>For each object all tags are shown. Click on a tag to get a little
        pop-up menu. Available options are to use the key/tag in the filter,
        or link to the <a href="https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/">taginfo</a>
        and OSM wiki pages for this key/tag, respectively. For some types
        of tags (like <tt>website</tt> and <tt>wikidata</tt>) a link to a
        suitable web site is also shown.</p>
        <h2>Direction of Ways</h2>
        <p>On zoom levels 17 and up, selected ways will show the direction
        the way is going with little arrows.</p>
        <h2>Tag Filters</h2>
        <p>The tag filter is only available in zoom level 14 and above.
        It allows filtering for keys or key/value pairs. Only objects matching
        the filter are shown.</p>
        <h2>Location Tool</h2>
        <img src="location-tool.png" alt="" width="500" style="border: 1px solid #a0a0a0; border-radius: 8px;"/>
        <p>At the bottom of the map is the Location Tool. It shows the
        coordinates of the mouse cursor, or alternatively the current map
        extent or the coordinates of the map center. Coordinates can be shown
        in lat/lon degrees or in Web Mercator units. The menu allows you to
        open the current location in the iD or JOSM editors or on the
        www.openstreetmap.org website.</p>
        <h2>Source</h2>
        <p>This map and the service behind it was created by <a
        href="https://www.jochentopf.com/">Jochen Topf</a>. It is based on
        <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>/<a href="https://postgis.net/">PostGIS</a>
        as database and uses <a href="https://osm2pgsql.org/">osm2pgsql</a>
        to import the OSM data. The tiles are generated using
        <a href="https://github.com/CrunchyData/pg_tileserv">pg_tileserv</a>.</p>
        <p>The source code
        is <a href="https://github.com/joto/osm-xray">available on Github</a>.
